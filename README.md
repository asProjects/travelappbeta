# travelappbeta
a REST based Web API programmed using PHP

The project is a part of a travel app project which was one of my college project. The frontend was made in .NET UWP platform.

It is scripted in Object Oriented PHP. It follows MVC conventions and is structured in following way - 
 
 1) API - This directory contains a single index file that is used to interact with whole API. It acts much like a url routing system found
    on MVC frameworks like ASP.NET.
 2) Models - This directory contains numerous classes that represents database interface of API.
 3) Controller - This directory contains the Controller class handles the request comming to API.
 4) Views - This directory classes responsible for serializing data objects into JSON.
